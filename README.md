Task 1 : EDA - Terrorism Dataset
dataset used : 'terrorData.csv'
The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the terrorism dataset to extract meaningful insights and patterns. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover trends, identify high-risk regions, understand attack characteristics, and potentially reveal factors that contribute to terrorist activities.

Task 2 : Email Spam Detection
dataset used : 'spam_ham_dataset.csv'
The goal of this project is to develop a robust email spam detection system using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the content and characteristics of emails, the system should be able to accurately classify incoming emails as either spam or legitimate (ham).
